Who We Are

The Fund for the Public Interest is seeking hard-working individuals with good communication skills and a passion for social change to fill citizen outreach and field manager positions across the country this summer.

If you are looking to make a difference working to protect the environment and public health, gain real-world work experience, make money, and work with great people, then this is the job for you. The skills and experience you will gain in one summer are great resume-builders and will last far beyond the summer you spend with us.


Our Mission:

The Fund for the Public Interest is a national, nonprofit organization that runs campaigns for America’s leading environmental and social change organizations, such as Environment America. We launched the Fund in 1982 to help find ways to engage people on the most pressing problems of our day and turn that support into solutions. By having face-to-face, one-on-one conversations we give thousands, sometimes millions of people the opportunity for their voices to be heard -- through petitions, emails, small donations and meetings. That’s people power, and that’s what it takes to make change.

This summer, we will be working with U.S. PIRG and Environment America to tackle climate change, save bees from dangerous pesticides, and stop single-use plastics from polluting our oceans and other waterways. Safety is our top priority. We will follow COVID safety protocols and local requirements to keep our staff and the public safe, including running our operation outside, social-distancing, remaining contactless, and providing all staff with masks. Ultimately, we know that it will take people power, and we can’t wait. So this summer we’re committed to adapting the strategies we’ve used for nearly 40 years to safely go out into communities and create the change we need.


Job Description:

We currently have paid canvasser and field manager positions open in select cities across the country. 


As a canvasser you will:

Educate and engage citizens on pressing equality issues.
Build membership and raise money for environmental and social change groups.
Track funds raised, campaign goals met and new members identified while canvassing.

As a field manager, in addition to canvassing every day, you will:

Help the directors launch the campaign and build a team of staff this summer.
Recruit, train and manage a team of staff in the office and in the field.
Develop the strategy to meet or exceed the campaign’s goals for fundraising and membership identification. 
Meet with the directors each week to evaluate progress and provide input on hiring decisions, goals and priorities.

You will also have the opportunity to organize press conferences and build coalitions with other nonprofit organizations. While on staff, you will gain knowledge of pressing concerns facing our country, learn how to effectively generate public support, and obtain a firm understanding of the political process.



Why Apply?

Whether you’re starting a career in politics or looking for an opportunity to gain communication and leadership experience, working in a summer canvass office allows you to learn skills you’ll need to be successful well into the future. You should apply if you want to…


Make a real difference on these issues.
Get experience with grassroots mobilization, fundraising and working with the media.
Gain the skills and experiences needed to launch a career in nonprofit, political or grassroots organizing.
Build long-lasting relationships with a team of people from all across the country who share your interests and concerns on important issues.

Qualifications

Passion for social change.
Excellent communication skills.
Strong work ethic.

Previous experience with staff management or leadership may improve candidacy.


Staff generally earn a base pay between $14-20/hr per hour, which varies by location. You are paid that base hourly pay for meeting the minimum performance standard, plus may earn an additional $1-7 per hour or more for exceeding the minimum performance standard. Staff never earn less than minimum wage for the hours that they work. So, you could earn between $14 and $20 per hour depending on performance.

Depending on your position, location and other factors you may be eligible for benefits including medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees and dependents, our commuter benefit program, 401(k) with employer match, paid time off and short-term disability insurance. We also offer an excellent training program and opportunities for advancement.


Fund for the Public Interest is an equal opportunity employer and will not discriminate against any employee or applicant on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, disability, pregnancy, or veteran status.

BACKGROUND
HopeWell is the largest nonprofit provider of foster care in Massachusetts and Connecticut, serving approximately 1000 foster youth annually through a comprehensive, youth-centered and trauma-informed approach. Through innovative solutions such as My First Place™, an education and employment program that provides safe, stable housing, and case management support for youth who have aged out of foster care, and with collaborative partnerships among stakeholders in government, health care, philanthropy, business, and social justice, HopeWell is driving the systems change urgently needed to raise the standards of the foster care experience so that every child can reach their potential in life.

ABOUT THE JOB 
HopeWell seeks an Education Director to strengthen existing partnerships and build new ones with leaders in education, child welfare, and health care to close the opportunity gap foster youth experience from preschool through high school. The Education Director will lead, launch, and grow our new program, RISE: Readiness, Inquiry, Scholarship, Education. RISE provides intensive, long-term, one-on-one tutoring and educational support for foster youth that also addresses social, emotional, and cognitive needs. Unlike traditional tutoring programs, RISE tutors are paired with students, not schools, so tutoring and support remains consistent throughout the four to eight changes of home placements and schools that most foster youth experience through age 18. With a deep commitment to education, child welfare, and social justice, the Education Director will bring an entrepreneurial mindset to the challenges of launching a new program and growing it statewide and beyond. A strategic, creative, and innovative leader and thinker, the Education Director will bring proven experience to the work of building and managing programs and teams from the ground up. 

The RISE program will start as a pilot in the fall of 2021, in or near the Greater Boston area. The Education Director will be responsible for getting the program off the ground, using data to flexibly and effectively improve the program, and ultimately growing the program from the pilot phase to full implementation. In the coming years, we intend to grow to implement RISE across Massachusetts and Connecticut, and to eventually partner with affiliate organizations across the country to adapt and implement RISE in their local communities. 

While High Impact Tutoring (often called High Dosage Tutoring or HDT) programs have recently demonstrated excellent outcomes data for the general population, they often don’t meet the unique needs of youth in foster care. We are currently engaging in an intensive discovery sprint to develop an evidence-informed, new program that is tailored to respond to these unique needs. As such, there will be a lot to learn once the program launches in order to most effectively close the achievement gap. The Education Director will be engaged in a continuous cycle of collecting and analyzing data, and using learnings from the program outcomes data to hone the program

This is an exciting opportunity to lead a growing team to transform what is possible for youth in foster care. We are seeking an entrepreneurial and innovative leader who is passionate about education, child welfare, and social justice and is enthusiastic about the idea of piloting, strengthening, and growing a brand new education program that delivers real results. This position requires an experienced professional whose alignment with HopeWell’s mission and this new initiative is matched with strong leadership, sound judgement in the face of complex challenges, and a proven track record of successfully managing programs and teams. The Education Director will thrive on strategic thinking and will excel at communication and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. This individual will have the strong ability and desire to work well BIPOC youth.


POSITION SUMMARY
The Education Director is an essential part of HopeWell’s senior leadership team, responsible for ensuring HopeWell’s mission, vision, and values are integrated into this new RISE program.

•	Providing some direct services in the early stages as the program is launching
•	Developing and implementing systems to manage all program operations
•	Hiring, managing, developing, and growing a team of tutors and educational support staff
•	Tracking and analyzing data in real time, adapting the program to respond to learnings  
•	Building and growing relationships with education and child welfare agencies and staff

Future growth of the program will involve significant opportunities for professional growth in this role. As RISE moves from pilot to full implementation, the position will oversee the full scope of the program’s operation and educational services and inspire a culture of continuous improvement that values learning and a commitment to quality. The Education Director will also work closely with the Vice President, Program Impact and Strategy and Vice President, Research, Policy, and Learning to provide strategic leadership to the RISE program.

Help Boston youth emerge from COVID and have fantastic summer experiences! We are hiring teams of summer day camp counselors to support youth in affordable housing neighborhoods throughout the city. Summer stipend of $3,500 with an education award upon successful completion.

The DREAM Program's (www.dreamprogram.org) mission is to close the opportunity gap for youth in affordable housing. With our nation’s history of systemic racial and economic oppression, DREAM recognizes that children living in affordable housing do not receive equitable access to educational and enrichment opportunities, which can be pivotal experiences in shaping a young person’s future. DREAM seeks a world in which all children have the opportunities, resources, and relationships necessary to achieve their dreams.

For more than 20 years, our water quality program has gathered high quality field science data with the aim of influencing public policy and practice in a way that protects our rivers, lakes and streams. MyRWA’s baseline water quality monitoring program forms the core of our annual Water Quality Report Card, co-published annually by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) and MyRWA. A long-term MyRWA study on nutrient pollution resulted in the publication of an Alternative TMDL Report on phosphorus pollution in 2020, co-issued by EPA and the Massachusetts Department of Protection. And recent grants support the work of siting more than 300 small-scale green infrastructure installations around the watershed. 

This is an exciting time to join a highly collaborative and dedicated team.

•	Transport of samples to EPA lab in Chelmsford, MA, and elsewhere.

Why? 

The Idan Project needs your help in seeking an answer to two important issues in contemporary society: why do so many students consider school to be stressful and unpleasant? How has the  opportunity for learning become so negative and ineffective for so many children?

Why for adults, has sex become easy thru ""hook-up' culture and the numerous commercial ""dating"" apps, but finding meaningful romantic love so hard? With all of the commercial random, mass-choice ""dating"" apps that are in operation, why is meeting someone for more than just one night become so tedious and unpleasant?

The Idan ['eedan]Project is a new, non-profit research organization of associates that focuses on the role of ideals in human behavior, and whether ideals can become less wishful fantasy, and more real in human behavior. 

Education and romantic introductions are two of the seminal subjects that have been selected by Idan Project associates for research and advocacy.  

We are recruiting idealistic individuals for both paid and volunteer part-time work as advocates of new, radical ideas for the formal education of children, and for finding meaningful adult romantic love.

If you are a practical idealist with part-time availability, we welcome your joining the Idan Project as either a volunteer or paid ""Idan Angel"". 

Please submit a letter of interest and cv for consideration.    "
